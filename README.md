# git_repo_makeover

This scripts were created as part of the Code.org summer swarm, a "makeover" of our code-dot-org Git repo. This included deleting old branches, 
cleaning up files and folders no longer in use, creating better documentation for our new engineers, and prototyping Git LFS (Large File Storage)
to help reduce the overall size of the repo.

As part of this swarm, the team decided to allow the option of squash merging when pull requests were merged. This [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10J2DcXf_71M-YKR1Wd3vgR6S7UH49teNuA6Jwu953Hs/edit#heading=h.326bqtb83h8x) investigated the pros and cons of squash merging.
